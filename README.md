# Adventure Game Project 
### (Udacity Introduction to Programming Nano Degreee Python section)

## Description 

In this project, you'll make a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:

* The game gives players a description of what's   happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
* Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
* The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
* The game has conditions for winning and losing.
* When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
* Check your style with pycodestyle
* * When you're all done with your program, be sure to check it using the pycodestyle toolâ€”and then fix any issues it raises.

## Dependencies 
* Python 3.0 or above
